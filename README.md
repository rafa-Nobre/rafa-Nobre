# Hello there! üëã

### Who am I? ü§î
My name is Denys Rafael and I currently live in Parnamirim/Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. I'm majoring in Information Technology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. <br />
Personally, I'm fictionalized in books, comics, games, coffee and programming!

### My knowledge üî≠
I already programmed in languages like C, C++ and Java, where I developed some projects throughout my university program. Some of these projects are right here in the repositories list! <br />
Javascript, HTML5 and CSS are also languages that i'm recently learning.

### What i am learning üå±
Recently I'm deepening my knowledge in React and React Native, frameworks that I've already developed some projects and that I'm currently working on. Axios and React Navigation are other tools that i'm current working too.

### Bonus feature ‚ú®
The digital games area is one of my favorites when I'm not doing other activities. I've participated in several projects involving game development, story telling and artificial intelligence for games. <br /> 
Particularly, I really like to study and stay on top of new technologies and frameworks!

### Talk to me! üì´
If you want to chat with me or disguss some ideas, i'm just a message away! <br />
